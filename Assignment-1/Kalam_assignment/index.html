        <p>
          ☛ A.P.J. Abdul Kalam, in full Avul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam, was
          born on October 15, 1931, in Rameswaram, Tamil Nadu, <br />
          India. <br />
          ☛ He served as the 11th President of India from 2002 to 2007.
          <br />
          ☛ Kalam earned a degree in aeronautical engineering from the Madras
          Institute of Technology and in 1958 joined the Defence <br />
          Research and Development Organisation (DRDO). <br />
          ☛ In 1969, he moved to the Indian Space Research Organisation, where
          he was project director of the SLV-III, the first satellite <br />
          launch vehicle that was both designed and produced in India. Rejoining
          DRDO in 1982, Kalam planned the program that produced a number of
          successful missiles, which helped earn him the <br />
          nickname <b>"Missile Man." </b><br />
          ☛ Among those successes was Agni, India's first intermediate-range
          ballistic missile, which incorporated aspects of the SLV-III and
          <br />
          was launched in 1989. <br />
          ☛ He also played a pivotal organisational, technical, and political
          role in India's Pokhran-II nuclear tests in 1998, the first since the
          <br />
          original nuclear test by India in 1974. <br />
          ☛ From 1992 to 1997 Kalam was scientific adviser to the defense
          minister, and he later served as principal scientific adviser (1999-
          <br />
          2001) to the government with the rank of cabinet minister. His
          prominent role in the country's 1998 nuclear weapons tests solidified
          India as a nuclear power and established Kalam as a <br />
          national hero, although the tests caused great concern in the
          international community. <br />
          ☛ In 1998 Kalam put forward a countrywide plan called Technology
          Vision 2020, which he described as a road map for transforming <br />
          India from a less-developed to a developed society in 20 years. The
          plan called for, among other measures, increasing agricultural <br />
          productivity, emphasizing technology as a vehicle for economic growth,
          and widening access to health care and education. <br />
          ☛ Kalam received 7 honorary doctorates from 40 universities. The
          Government of India honoured him with the
          <b>Padma Bhushan in 1981</b> and the <b>Padma Vibhushan</b> <br />
          in 1990 for his work with ISRO and DRDO and his role as a scientific
          advisor to the <br />
          Government. <br />
          ☛ In 1997, Kalam received India's highest civilian honour, the Bharat
          Ratna, for his contribution to the scientific research and <br />
          modernisation of defence technology in India. <br />
          ☛ In 2013, he was the recipient of the Von Braun Award from the
          National Space Society "to recognize excellence in the management
          <br />
          and leadership of a space-related project". <br />
          ☛ While delivering a lecture at the Indian Institute of Management
          Shillong, Kalam collapsed and died from an apparent cardiac <br />
          arrest on <b> 27 July 2015,</b> aged 83. <br />
          ☛ Wheeler Island, a national missile test site in Odisha, was renamed
          <b>Kalam Island</b> in September 2015. <br />
          ☛ A prominent road in New Delhi was renamed from Aurangzeb Road to
          <b>Dr APJ Abdul Kalam</b> Road in August 2015. <br />
          ☛ In February 2018, scientists from the Botanical Survey of India
          named a newly found plant species as Drypetes kalamii, in his <br />
          honour.
